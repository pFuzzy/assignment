Difficulties
1. Working with Eclipse
	- I have only worked with IntelliJ before and it was quite difficult to get used to a new IDE(interface, keybinds etc.)
	- I usually prefer handling Git from IDE and Eclipse seemed a bit more sophisticated about adding remote repository,
	  so managing Git from IDE took a while to figure out
2. Working with SOAP
	- Previously I had little to no knowledge and experience about this topic so setting up the project and creating           	  endpoints proved a great challenge and it is very much an "experience first, understand later" type of project

3. What to push to repository
	- Since I haven't worked with these kinds of projects I didn't know what usually is in a gitignore for this and how it 	  	  usually looks as a "completed" project
	- I ended up not pushing generated code since building with maven, the jax2b plugin should create necessary classes
